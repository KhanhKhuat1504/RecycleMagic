# RecycleMagic

![Demo](./RecycleMagic.jpeg)

## 🌟 Inspiration
Tracking where recyclables end up is a global challenge. Many recycling plants and facilities lack the technology to monitor the journey of recyclables, leading to inefficiencies and missed opportunities for proper waste management. **RecycleMagic** aims to bridge this gap by providing a seamless, tech-driven solution.

---

## 🚀 What It Does
**RecycleMagic** uses **QR codes** to track recyclables from the point of disposal to recycling plants.  
- When recyclables arrive at a recycling plant, their QR codes are scanned and logged into our system.
- If a recycling plant lacks internet connectivity, the **Skylo satellite IoT device network** ensures data is transmitted without interruptions.
